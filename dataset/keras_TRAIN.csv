keras,1,#10845,f6fad22671db9506acee34b9fd33361de78ab148,"Rnn.Call Should Get Initial State From Full Input Spec### Summary
This Pr Fix A Critical Bug In ```Rnn``` Which Reported At #9449 And #10830 .

In ```Rnn.Call```, If ```Initial_State``` Is A Tensor That Was Returned By A Keras Layer, We Should Get ```Initial_State``` From Full Input Spec(Including Training Data, State And Constants) Which Was Generated At ```Rnn.__Call__```, As It Could Be Copied To Multiple Gpus. Otherwise, It Would Use The Original ```Initial_States``` Which Is Not Be Sliced According The Number Of Gpus.
Btw, I Have Also Check ```Cudnnrnn```, It Use The Correct Way, So We Don'T Need To Modify It.

I Run The Following Test Code In A Machine With 2 Gpus, It Works Well After This Fix.
```

Import Keras
From Keras Import Layers As L
From Keras.Models Import Sequential, Model
From Keras.Utils.Multi_Gpu_Utils Import Multi_Gpu_Model

@Taehoonlee 

Allow Me To Propose An Alternative To The `Assert_Value_With_Ref` Method For The Numpy Reference Operations.
The Limitation Which I See With This Approach Is That It Will Be Hard To Track The Progress Of The Removal Of The Other Backends (I May Be Wrong, Feel Free To Correct Me It'S Possible I Haven'T Read The Code Well Enough).

I Propose That We Consider The Numpy Backend As A True Backend For The Tests (Without Gradients Of Course).
I Created A New Variable Called `Backend_And_Np` Which Is Similar To `Backends` And Will Hopefully Replace It.

Once We Manage To Remove All Occurences Of `Kc`, `Ktf`, `Kth` And `Backends`, We Should Be Able To Removed Unnecessary Installs Of Backends.

I Made A Small Example Here For The `Reshape` Backend Function.

What Are Your Thoughts On This?

Adding Code To The Initialization Function Of `Hdf5Matrix` So That `.Dtype` And `.Shape` Reflect The Actual Values Returned By The Normalizer. This Is Particularly Important Because The `Model.Fit` Function Looks At The Shape To Determine If The Code Can Be Run And If There Are Changes To Shape (Random Cropping, Downsampling, Edge Removal, ...) Performed In The Normalizer These Are Not Currently Reflected In The `.Shape` Property. The Dtype Mismatch Currently Does Not Cause Any Issues (That I Know Of) But Should Also Be Adjusted As Well.

The Problem Is Caused By [Line 237](Https://Github.Com/Keras-Team/Keras/Blob/Master/Keras/Utils/Multi_Gpu_Utils.Py#L237) On Current Implementation Of `Multi_Gpu_Model()`. The Values Of `Model.Output_Names` Can Be Non-Unique And Thus We Get Valueerror Exceptions. The Pr Handles This Case By Choosing Unique Names For The Outputs That Have Conflicts. 

Example: In The Above Snippet The `Siamese.Output_Names` Has Value `['Add_1', 'Nested', 'Nested']`. To Avoid Duplicate Layer Names The Proposed Code Will Update `Parallel_Siamese.Output_Names` Value To `['Add_1', 'Nested_1', 'Nested_2']`.

The Main Problem Is From Different Padding Behaviour Of `Conv2D(Filters, Kernel, Padding='Same', Strides=(2, 2))`. With Explicit `Zeropadding2D`, Tensorflow Is Able To Show Small Numerical Differences.

Added Two New Optional Arguments To `Plot_Model` Function In `Vis_Utils.Py`, To Be Able To Visualize Nested (Wrapped) Models. Also Adds `Dpi` Param To Have Ability To Produce High Resolution Graphs.

For Example Giving This Model:
```Python
Sentence_Input = Input(Shape=(2, 3), Dtype='Float32', Name=""Input2"")
L_Lstm = Bidirectional(Lstm(16))(Sentence_Input)
Sent_Encoder = Model(Sentence_Input, L_Lstm)
Review_Input = Input(Shape=(5, 2, 3), Dtype='Float32')
Review_Encoder = Timedistributed(Sent_Encoder)(Review_Input)
L_Lstm_Sent = Lstm(16)(Review_Encoder)
Preds = Dense(5, Activation='Softmax')(L_Lstm_Sent)
Model = Model(Review_Input, Preds)
Vis_Utils.Plot_Model(Model, To_File='Model3.Png', Show_Shapes=True,
                     Expand_Nested=True, Dpi=300)
```
Will Produce:

### Summary
In The Case When Fetching The Batch From The Worker Is Not Finished Within The Timeout, `Queue.Task_Done` Method Is Not Called. This Leads To A Deadlock At The End Of The Epoch When We Do `Self._Wait_Queue()` Preventing From Getting Batches For The Next Epoch. The Correct Behavior Would Be To Mark Task In The Queue As Done Regardless Of If It Was Processed In The Worker Or On The Main Thread After The Timeout.

2D Dilated Convolution Gives Wrong Output For Cntk Backend:

Output Is:
```

Y.Shape = (1, 4, 4, 1)
```
The Output Shape Should Be ```(None, 6, 6, 1)``` According Keras Shape Inference, But It'S ```(1, 4, 4, 1)``` After Evaluation. This Is Because It Passed ```Dilation_Rate``` To ```Strides``` By Mistake At Cntk Backend When ```Dilation > 2```. 

### How To Test This Fix
There Is ```Test_Convolution_2D``` In ```Convolutional_Test.Py```, But I Still Skip It Due To Cntk Only Supports Dilated Convolution On Gpu, But Ci Doesn'T Have Gpu Node. I Run The Following Code With Tf Backend(Cpu Or Gpu) And Cntk Backend(Gpu), They Gives The Same Output.
Test Code:
```
From Keras.Layers Import Input, Conv2D
From Keras.Models Import Model
From Keras.Initializers Import Constant
Import Numpy As Np

Kernel = Np.Arange(9).Reshape((3, 3, 1, 1))
Print(Kernel.Shape)

Inputs = Input(Shape=(10, 10, 1))
M = Conv2D(1, Kernel_Size=(3,3), Padding='Valid', Dilation_Rate=(2, 2), Kernel_Initializer=Constant(Kernel))(Inputs)
Model = Model(Inputs=Inputs, Outputs=M)
Model.Summary()


X = Np.Arange(100).Reshape((1, 10, 10, 1)).Astype(Np.Float32) 
Y = Model.Predict(X)

```
Output:

For Detailed Discussion Consider Referring To The Issue #11217 

Overview:
In Version 2.2.2 Of Keras Building Model Without Specifying `Input_Shape` Or `Batch_Input_Shape` Is Allowed But For Such Cases, The Model Will Not Be Actually Built Implicitly And You Need To Build The Model Explicitly Either By Calling `Model.Build()` Or Else `Model.Fit()` On Some Data. If You Call `Model.Summary()` Before Building The Model It Will Give A ""Model Not Built"" Error But The Possible Solutions To Such Error Are

1. Add `Input_Shape` Or `Batch_Input_Size` In The First Layer
2. Call `Model.Build()` Before `Model.Summary()`
3. Call `Model.Fit()` On Some Data Before `Model.Summary()`

But The Previous Error Message Was Only Suggesting Solution 3 Which Seems Unintutive. 

So I Have Rewritten The Error Message To Suggest All Three Possible Solutions

This Pr Resolves Two Issues:
1) The `Get_Function_Signature` In `Autogen.Py` Duplicates Module Name For Non-Method Functions. For Example, It Returns `Keras.Preprocessing.Sequence.Keras.Preprocessing.Sequence.Pad_Sequences` Instead Of `Keras.Preprocessing.Sequence.Pad_Sequences`.

2) Method Functions And Non-Method Functions Should Be Distinguished From Each Other. Since, The Module Name Of Non-Method Functions Should Be Included In The Signature In The Docs (Like `Keras.Preprocessing.Sequence.Pad_Sequences(...)`) Whereas For The Methods Of Classes It Should Not Be Included (Like `Compile(...)` For `Sequential` Class). Therefore, A New `'Methods'` Key Is Introduced To Make This Distinction.

If The Number Of Channels Is Great Than 1, We Should Add A Non-Zero Value At The Begin Of ```Dilation``` To Line Up With The Input Channel Axis For ```C.Convolution```. The Extra Non-Zero Value Doesn'T Have Effect Even If The Number Of Channels Is 1, So We Can Always Add A Prefix ```(1,)``` To ```Dilation_Rate``` When Calling ```C.Convolution```. This Pr Fixed This Bug In ```Conv1D, Conv2D, Conv3D, Conv2Dtranspose```. For Other Conv Layers, It Has Several Other Issues Should Be Fixed As Well, I'Ll Send Follow-Up Prs Later.
I Found Related Unit Tests Only Run Cases That The Number Of Channels Is 1.

### Summary

Hello,

Now If You Check We'Ve Specified 

> Max_Num_Words = 3

 But Tokenizer Return **N-1** Words I.E **2**. So We Only Have Two Words In Our Integer Coded Corpus.
```
Num_Words = Min(Max_Num_Words, Len(Tokenizer.Word_Index) + 1)      # I.E Min(3, 8 + 1)
Embedding_Matrix = Np.Zeros((Num_Words, 10))
Print(Embedding_Matrix.Shape)
(3, 10)
```

Then This Should Be How We Create Embedding Matrix.
```
For Word, I In Word_Index.Items():
    If I >= Max_Num_Words:     # I. E I >= 3 We Also Don'T Want Word Three To Be Included.
        Continue
    Embedding_Vector = Embeddings_Index.Get(Word)
    If Embedding_Vector Is Not None:
         Embedding_Matrix[I] = Embedding_Vector
```

Having Blocks Of Code In Multiple Sections Of The Same Docstring Breaks The Rendering Of The Documentation. To See Exactly What I Mean, See The Test Which I Added.

### Related Issues

### Pr Overview

The Problem Came From This Line:
Https://Github.Com/Keras-Team/Keras/Blob/267Ccbb4A76913680F4Db6B400E05Dea7Aa84Db7/Docs/Autogen.Py#L456

Because The `Replace` Was Used On The Full Docstring (Not The Slice Of The Docstring Correnponding To The Section Being Worked On), Even Code Blocks Which Were In Other Sections Were Replaced.

So As The Parser Progressed, Some Code Blocks Were Replaced Multiple Times, And The Parser Lost The Content Of The Last Blocks Of Code, Because The Parser Only Remember What It Just Replaced. 
See This Line Which Does It: Https://Github.Com/Keras-Team/Keras/Blob/267Ccbb4A76913680F4Db6B400E05Dea7Aa84Db7/Docs/Autogen.Py#L453

When We Arrive At This Line For The Last Code Block, The Code Isn'T There, Only The Marker. So The Marker Gets Saved Instead Of `$Code_Block_%D`. 

Feel Free To Use A Debugger To Understand What I Mean. I Hope I Was Clear Enough. I Advise The Reviewer To Be Very Careful, As This Pr Can Potentially Break Many Pages In The Docs. I Checked Most Of Them, But Well... We Never Know.

For Example, If I Do A Pr Enabling E501 In `Docs/Autogen.Py`, Then, I Would Have To Modify Only Two Files:
* `Docs/Autogen.Py` To Make The Lines Shorter.
* `Pytest.Ini` To Remove The Corresponding Line And Avoid Any Future Regression.

@Taehoonlee 

Allow Me To Propose An Alternative To The `Assert_Value_With_Ref` Method For The Numpy Reference Operations.
The Limitation Which I See With This Approach Is That It Will Be Hard To Track The Progress Of The Removal Of The Other Backends (I May Be Wrong, Feel Free To Correct Me It'S Possible I Haven'T Read The Code Well Enough).

I Propose That We Consider The Numpy Backend As A True Backend For The Tests (Without Gradients Of Course).
I Created A New Variable Called `Backend_And_Np` Which Is Similar To `Backends` And Will Hopefully Replace It.

Once We Manage To Remove All Occurences Of `Kc`, `Ktf`, `Kth` And `Backends`, We Should Be Able To Removed Unnecessary Installs Of Backends.

I Made A Small Example Here For The `Reshape` Backend Function.

What Are Your Thoughts On This?

For Detailed Discussion Consider Referring To The Issue #11217 

Overview:
In Version 2.2.2 Of Keras Building Model Without Specifying `Input_Shape` Or `Batch_Input_Shape` Is Allowed But For Such Cases, The Model Will Not Be Actually Built Implicitly And You Need To Build The Model Explicitly Either By Calling `Model.Build()` Or Else `Model.Fit()` On Some Data. If You Call `Model.Summary()` Before Building The Model It Will Give A ""Model Not Built"" Error But The Possible Solutions To Such Error Are

1. Add `Input_Shape` Or `Batch_Input_Size` In The First Layer
2. Call `Model.Build()` Before `Model.Summary()`
3. Call `Model.Fit()` On Some Data Before `Model.Summary()`

But The Previous Error Message Was Only Suggesting Solution 3 Which Seems Unintutive. 

So I Have Rewritten The Error Message To Suggest All Three Possible Solutions

When Using A Lambda Layer And Cntk, The User Have To Give The Function To Compute The Output Shape. But Cntk Can Infer It (Like Tensorflow). So It Would Make Sense To Do It For The User And Make The Api Even Cleaner.
### Related Issues

### Pr Overview

#### Main Changes
Some Docs Updates, As Well As A Test For Checking That A Lambda Layer Can Handle A Function Which Changes The Shape Of The Input.

#### Fixing A Tests That Was Not Working As Intended.
`Test_Sgd` Was Broken After My Modification. Which Was Really Strange. I Investigated And The Test Was Not Working As Intended. Let Me Explain:

The Function `_Test_No_Grad` Is Supposed To Test That A `Valueerror` Is Raised When There Is No Gradient.
But Only Tensorflow Can Detect This Anomaly And Raise The Error. So Why Isn'T This Test Skipped With Other Backends? The Test Was Working On All Backends But The `Valueerror` Was Different (This Is Before My Modification, Result Obtained On The Master Branch):

**Theano**
`Valueerror: Error When Checking Target: Expected Lambda_1 To Have Shape (10,) But Got Array With Shape (1,)`

**Tensorflow**
`Valueerror: An Operation Has `None` For Gradient. Please Make Sure That All Of Your Ops Have A Gradient Defined (I.E. Are Differentiable). Common Ops Without Gradient: K.Argmax, K.Round, K.Eval.`

**Cntk**
`Valueerror: Error When Checking Target: Expected Lambda_1 To Have Shape (10,) But Got Array With Shape (1,)`

So The Test Was Passing For All Backends! Because The Person Who Made The Test Forgot To Add The Argument `Output_Shape` To The Lambda Layer.

The Test Have Been Fixed. Now Everything Is Working As Intended.

### End Note:
Maybe `Test_No_Grad` Should Not Exist At All? We Are Testing A Tensorflow Feature. It Would Make More Sense If This Test Was In The Tensorflow Test Suite And Not In The Keras One.

@Taehoonlee 

Allow Me To Propose An Alternative To The `Assert_Value_With_Ref` Method For The Numpy Reference Operations.
The Limitation Which I See With This Approach Is That It Will Be Hard To Track The Progress Of The Removal Of The Other Backends (I May Be Wrong, Feel Free To Correct Me It'S Possible I Haven'T Read The Code Well Enough).

I Propose That We Consider The Numpy Backend As A True Backend For The Tests (Without Gradients Of Course).
I Created A New Variable Called `Backend_And_Np` Which Is Similar To `Backends` And Will Hopefully Replace It.

Once We Manage To Remove All Occurences Of `Kc`, `Ktf`, `Kth` And `Backends`, We Should Be Able To Removed Unnecessary Installs Of Backends.

I Made A Small Example Here For The `Reshape` Backend Function.

What Are Your Thoughts On This?

This Seems, To Me, More Intuitive Behaviour.

This Pr Gives The User Explicit Control Over The Behaviour By Introducing `Copy` Keyword Argument To The Relevant Functions. This Way, The Earlier Behaviour Can Be Regained If The User So Wishes.

The Generation Of The Parameters Happens In `Get_Random_Transform()` Function Which Outputs A Dictionary Of Transformation Parameters Randomly Chosen. The Transform Can Then Be Applied In A New `Apply_Transform()` Function.

My Aim Is To Eventually Enable More Generalized Usage For Imagedatagenerator; For Example, Transformation Of Segmentation Coordinates In An Image Segmentation Problem Along With The Image Itself. Since This Is Going To Be Quite A Big Upgrade, I'M Doing It In Smaller Steps At A Time To Be Sure Not To Break Anything Too Horribly. This Refactorization Is The First Step.

Some Design Choices I Have Made Here:

* Representing A Transformation As A Dictionary Of Transformation Parameters And Values Corresponding To Each Of Them. Other Choice Would Be Just A List Or Tuple Of The Values, But I Think This Way Is More Generalizable In The Future If We Want E.G. Custom Transformation Functions (For Image Segmentation Coordinates)

* Keeping All The Old Functions (`Random_Transform()` For Instance) Even Though They Are Not Strictly Needed. This Is Not To Break Any Existing Functionality Anywhere Else. Now The Old Functions Just Call The New Functions.

To Elaborate On My Future Vision On The Imagedatagenerator: My Plan Is That Eventually It Would Be Able To Process A List Of Inputs And A List Of Outputs, Some Of Which Might Be Images And Some Which Might Be Something Else. It Would Also Take, As A Constructor Parameter, A List Of Transformations That Need To Applied To Each Of The Inputs And Outputs. The Manner In Which A Given Transformation Acts On A Given Type Of Input Is Specified By Giving Separate Set Of Transformation Functions For Each Input/Output. Some Of Them Can Be In-Build (E.G. What We Have Now) Or User Defined.

Having Blocks Of Code In Multiple Sections Of The Same Docstring Breaks The Rendering Of The Documentation. To See Exactly What I Mean, See The Test Which I Added.

### Related Issues

### Pr Overview

The Problem Came From This Line:
Https://Github.Com/Keras-Team/Keras/Blob/267Ccbb4A76913680F4Db6B400E05Dea7Aa84Db7/Docs/Autogen.Py#L456

Because The `Replace` Was Used On The Full Docstring (Not The Slice Of The Docstring Correnponding To The Section Being Worked On), Even Code Blocks Which Were In Other Sections Were Replaced.

So As The Parser Progressed, Some Code Blocks Were Replaced Multiple Times, And The Parser Lost The Content Of The Last Blocks Of Code, Because The Parser Only Remember What It Just Replaced. 
See This Line Which Does It: Https://Github.Com/Keras-Team/Keras/Blob/267Ccbb4A76913680F4Db6B400E05Dea7Aa84Db7/Docs/Autogen.Py#L453

When We Arrive At This Line For The Last Code Block, The Code Isn'T There, Only The Marker. So The Marker Gets Saved Instead Of `$Code_Block_%D`. 

Feel Free To Use A Debugger To Understand What I Mean. I Hope I Was Clear Enough. I Advise The Reviewer To Be Very Careful, As This Pr Can Potentially Break Many Pages In The Docs. I Checked Most Of Them, But Well... We Never Know.

Having Blocks Of Code In Multiple Sections Of The Same Docstring Breaks The Rendering Of The Documentation. To See Exactly What I Mean, See The Test Which I Added.

### Related Issues

### Pr Overview

The Problem Came From This Line:
Https://Github.Com/Keras-Team/Keras/Blob/267Ccbb4A76913680F4Db6B400E05Dea7Aa84Db7/Docs/Autogen.Py#L456

Because The `Replace` Was Used On The Full Docstring (Not The Slice Of The Docstring Correnponding To The Section Being Worked On), Even Code Blocks Which Were In Other Sections Were Replaced.

So As The Parser Progressed, Some Code Blocks Were Replaced Multiple Times, And The Parser Lost The Content Of The Last Blocks Of Code, Because The Parser Only Remember What It Just Replaced. 
See This Line Which Does It: Https://Github.Com/Keras-Team/Keras/Blob/267Ccbb4A76913680F4Db6B400E05Dea7Aa84Db7/Docs/Autogen.Py#L453

When We Arrive At This Line For The Last Code Block, The Code Isn'T There, Only The Marker. So The Marker Gets Saved Instead Of `$Code_Block_%D`. 

Feel Free To Use A Debugger To Understand What I Mean. I Hope I Was Clear Enough. I Advise The Reviewer To Be Very Careful, As This Pr Can Potentially Break Many Pages In The Docs. I Checked Most Of Them, But Well... We Never Know.

* Fix shape mismatch in `rnn()` of tensorflow_backend

Fix the shape mismatch in `rnn()` with `not unroll` and `mask is not None` of the Tensorflow backend.

Problem: If the rnn cell has any (recurrent) `states[i]` whose shape is different from that of the `output` (`states[0]`), there will raise an `ValueError` when updating that state.

Reason: This is because the `tiled_mask_t` is not updated correctly for each `states[i]` but instead is simply copied from that of the `output` (`states[0]`).

Solution: Tile the `mask_t` with the correct shape of each `states[i]`. Notice that in a similar situation with `unroll is True`, the `tiled_mask_t` is handled correctly.

2D Dilated Convolution Gives Wrong Output For Cntk Backend:

Output Is:

```
The Output Shape Should Be ```(None, 6, 6, 1)``` According Keras Shape Inference, But It'S ```(1, 4, 4, 1)``` After Evaluation. This Is Because It Passed ```Dilation_Rate``` To ```Strides``` By Mistake At Cntk Backend When ```Dilation > 2```. 

### How To Test This Fix
There Is ```Test_Convolution_2D``` In ```Convolutional_Test.Py```, But I Still Skip It Due To Cntk Only Supports Dilated Convolution On Gpu, But Ci Doesn'T Have Gpu Node. I Run The Following Code With Tf Backend(Cpu Or Gpu) And Cntk Backend(Gpu), They Gives The Same Output.
Test Code:
```
From Keras.Layers Import Input, Conv2D
From Keras.Models Import Model
From Keras.Initializers Import Constant
Import Numpy As Np

Kernel = Np.Arange(9).Reshape((3, 3, 1, 1))
Print(Kernel.Shape)

Inputs = Input(Shape=(10, 10, 1))
M = Conv2D(1, Kernel_Size=(3,3), Padding='Valid', Dilation_Rate=(2, 2), Kernel_Initializer=Constant(Kernel))(Inputs)
Model = Model(Inputs=Inputs, Outputs=M)
Model.Summary()


X = Np.Arange(100).Reshape((1, 10, 10, 1)).Astype(Np.Float32) 
Y = Model.Predict(X)

Print(Np.Squeeze(Y))

```
Output:

@Taehoonlee 

Allow Me To Propose An Alternative To The `Assert_Value_With_Ref` Method For The Numpy Reference Operations.
The Limitation Which I See With This Approach Is That It Will Be Hard To Track The Progress Of The Removal Of The Other Backends (I May Be Wrong, Feel Free To Correct Me It'S Possible I Haven'T Read The Code Well Enough).

I Propose That We Consider The Numpy Backend As A True Backend For The Tests (Without Gradients Of Course).
I Created A New Variable Called `Backend_And_Np` Which Is Similar To `Backends` And Will Hopefully Replace It.

Once We Manage To Remove All Occurences Of `Kc`, `Ktf`, `Kth` And `Backends`, We Should Be Able To Removed Unnecessary Installs Of Backends.

I Made A Small Example Here For The `Reshape` Backend Function.

What Are Your Thoughts On This?

  *  Prevent Stateful Metrics To Leak Np.Floats To The History Object: When Logging Normal Metrics, They Are Added In _*_Loop() To 0., Making Them Float. This Doesn'T Happen With Stateful Metrics (They Are Assigned Directly), So They Are Np.Float32. This Is Annoying If You E.G. Want To Serialize The History Object To Json After Training, Which Used To Work Fine Before.

  *  Progbar: Format Stateful Metrics Values As Floats Alike Other Metrics:  In Progress Bar (Verbose=1), Stateful Metric Values Aren'T Formatted As %.4F But %S. This Is Messy With Many Metrics, But Also Sometimes One \B Too Many Is Printed (Didn'T Find Out Why) And The Progress Bar Jumps A Line Upwards (Overwriting Earlier Content)

keras,0,10242,2eed2a5d688e8720740f30d281a18fb2c13a15fd,"Handle `Mask` In `Timedistributed` Wrapper.This Pr Aims To Add Proper Support Of `Mask` In `Timedistributed` Wrapper Layer. Several Previous Prs Have Raised Questions About This Or Have Attempted To Solve It, But I Didn'T Find Any Perfect Solution So Far. I May Not Be Able To Have A Perfect One Either But Am Willing To Improve It. The Most Frequent Usage Of Such Layers With Masking Support Might Be A Hierarchical Rnn On A Sentence With Words With Characters, Or A Paragraph With Sentences With Words. (E.G., Models Like [This](Https://Github.Com/Keras-Team/Keras/Blob/Master/Examples/Mnist_Hierarchical_Rnn.Py)).

Here Are The Main Ideas/Purposes Of This Pr:

1) For Layers Like `Timedistributed(Embedding(..., Mask_Zero=True))` Or `Timedistributed(Masking(...))`, The Layer Should Call `Compute_Mask()` At Each Time Step And Stack Them.
2) For Layers Like `Timedistributed(Lstm(...))`, The `Input_Mask` Should Be Split And Fed Into The `Lstm` Layer At Each Time Step. And If The `Output_Shape` Changes (E.G., `Return_Sequences=False` In `Lstm`), The `Output_Mask` Of The `Timedistributed` Layer Should Also Change Correspondingly.
3) The `Timedistributed` Layer Should Support, E.G., `Input_Shape=(None, None)`. For Example, The Number Of Words In A Sentence And The Number Of Characters In A Word Can Be Different From Sample To Sample. Currently The `Timedistributed` Can Only Support One Unspecified Input Dimension.

Here Are Some Details Of This Pr To Discuss, Which Might Have Better Solutions:
1) `K.Int_Shape()` May Not Be Available For Some `Mask` With `Theano` Backend, Especially When The Inner Layer Is `Embedding` Or `Masking`. This Is Because `_Keras_Shape` Is Not Set In Lots Of Operations In `Theano_Backend` If The Tensor Shape Is Not Changed. I Manually Create The `_Keras_Shape` In `Compute_Mask` Of These Two Layers.
2) When `Input_Shape[0] Is Not None` In `Timedistributed` Layer, We Need To Use `K.Rnn()` To Dynamically Call The Inner Layer. Because `K.Rnn()` Can Only Take 1 Tensor Input But We Need To Feed Both `Input` And `Mask`, I Didn'T Do Anything In This Situation. Probably We Can Pass All `Mask` As Constants To `K.Rnn()` But I Was Expecting Better Solutions.
3) If There'S `None` From The Output Of `K.Int_Shape`, We Need To Replace It By The Output From `K.Shape`, So That `Reshape` Can Be Correctly Called.

Comparing To Numpy Operations Allow Us To Know Which Backend Fails In Case Of Unexpected Result (Let'S Say The Theano Backend Changes, The Failure Will Only Happen In The Theano Build On Travis When Comparing To Numpy), And Have A Good Ground Truth For Tests. 

It'S Also Good For Documentation Purposes, In Case We Wonder What The Real Definition Of An Op In The Keras Backend Is.

**Caveat**: Inputs Tensors Must Have A Static Batch Size. This Limitation Does Not Exist In `Tf.Keras`. Lifting This Limitation In Multi-Backend Keras Is Doable But Fairly Involved. First We Need All Backends To Implement `Placeholder_With_Default`. That Part Is Relatively Straightforward (By Using Regular Placeholders And Feeding The Default If A Value Is Not Provided, At The Level Of `K.Function`), But Will Take A Bit Of Work. Then We Need To Switch The Sample Weight Placeholders To Be Placeholders With Default Values Of 1.

* Fix shape mismatch in `rnn()` of tensorflow_backend

Fix the shape mismatch in `rnn()` with `not unroll` and `mask is not None` of the Tensorflow backend.

Problem: If the rnn cell has any (recurrent) `states[i]` whose shape is different from that of the `output` (`states[0]`), there will raise an `ValueError` when updating that state.

Reason: This is because the `tiled_mask_t` is not updated correctly for each `states[i]` but instead is simply copied from that of the `output` (`states[0]`).

Solution: Tile the `mask_t` with the correct shape of each `states[i]`. Notice that in a similar situation with `unroll is True`, the `tiled_mask_t` is handled correctly.

Readers Expect Frequent Patterns To Be Defaults When Calling Functions. Reading Though `Test_Callbacks.Py` Isn'T Easy Because One Have To Check All The Arguments Of `Get_Test_Data` Every Time To Check That Something Out Of The Ordinary Isn'T There.
This Pr Allows The Reader To Quickly Know What Differs From One Test To Another. I Think It Improves Readability.

Currently We Have 2 Types Of Models (`Sequential`, `Model`) And 25+ Types Of Layers.
In The Tests, We Test Each Type Of Layer In Each Type Of Model.
But `Sequential` Derives From `Model`, So In Fact, If Layers Work In `Model` They'Re Expected To Work In `Sequential`. 

The Effect Of This Pr Is That It Halves The Running Time Of The Layer Tests In All Backends (See The Logs).

Support Loading And Saving (Models And Weights) To/From Any Binary Stream (File-Like Object):

_Note: As Opposed To Other Pr:S With ""Saving To Binary"" In The Title, This Pr Goes One Step Further And Extends The Api To Write And Load Directly To File-Like Objects, Thus Making It Possible To Also Load Models From Binary Data (Without First Having To Store It On Disk)._

This Is Usefull Since It Is The Most General Kind Of Serialization (See This Request Https://Github.Com/Keras-Team/Keras/Issues/9343) And Allows Saving/Loading Models In Environments Where We Don'T Have Disk Access Such As Colab (See Https://Github.Com/Keras-Team/Keras/Pull/11636#Discussion_R234426668).

#### Examples
Saving Binary:
```
With Open(Fname, 'Wb') As Raw_File:
    Save_Model(Model, Raw_File)
With H5Py.File(Fname, Mode='R') As H5File:
    Loaded_Model = Load_Model(H5File)
```
Loading Binary:
```
With H5Py.File(Fname, Mode='W') As H5File:
    Save_Model(Model, H5File)
With Open(Fname, 'Rb') As Raw_File:
    Loaded_Model = Load_Model(Raw_File)
```
Or Both - Fully In Memory:
```
Stream = Io.Bytesio()
Save_Model(Model, Stream)
Stream.Seek(0)
Loaded_Model = Load_Model(Stream)
```

This Makes The Output Of Get_Config Consistent Across All Model Classes.

However, Keras Now Raises An `Unboundlocalerror` Exception Whenever Loading A Legacy Configuration File. In `From_Config`, `Name` Can Be Undefined If This Variable Is Not Present In The Config, And In Line 298 Of The Modified File, Is Used By `Model = Cls(Name=Name)`.

I Modified The Code Such That Legacy Configs Still Load, But Throws A Warning. Maybe A Different Behavior Is Desired, But Keras, In My Opinion, Shouldn'T Crash Like This (Especially Without Any Warnings).

```Batchnormalization``` Layer, Mean/Var/Beta/Gama Tensors May Be [Broadcast](Https://Github.Com/Keras-Team/Keras/Blob/Master/Keras/Layers/Normalization.Py#L140). 
```
Input = Input(Shape=(3, 1001, 1001), Dtype='Float32')
X = Conv2D(Filters=64, Kernel_Size=(3, 3), Strides=1, Padding='Same')(Input)
X = Batchnormalization(Axis=1)(X)
```
In The Above Example, As You Set ```Axis=1```, The Mean/Var/Beta/Gama Tensors Would Be Reshaped As [1,64,1,1]. For Tf Backend, It Will Try To Call The Optimized ```Tf.Nn.Fused_Batch_Norm``` If Possible. But ```Tf.Nn.Fused_Batch_Norm``` Only Accept Mean/Var/Beta/Gama As 1 Dimension Tensor, We Need To Squeeze Them Ahead.
Actually We Have Did Same Preprocessing For [Cntk Backend](Https://Github.Com/Keras-Team/Keras/Blob/Master/Keras/Backend/Cntk_Backend.Py#L1070).

Note: This Bug Should Only Happened When Tf-Gpu As Backend, Since Tf-Cpu Fusedbatchnorm Doesn'T Support Nchw Format, And It Will Fall Back To The Default ```Tf.Nn.Batch_Normalization```.

Thanks @Ahundt For Your Work. I Was Able To Get Theano Working And Be Compatible With What Was Doing Tensorflow, But Only For (2, 2) Upscaling. Other Factors Like (4, 4) Show Different Results For The Theano'S Implementation And The Tensorflow'S Implementation. 
I Also Couldn'T Figure Out How To Use Other Factors Like (3, 2) With Theano. Which Is Why, With The Theano Backend, For Implementation And Backend Compatibility Reasons, Only (2, 2) Is Implemented.

### How To Test This Fix
There Is ```Test_Convolution_2D``` In ```Convolutional_Test.Py```, But I Still Skip It Due To Cntk Only Supports Dilated Convolution On Gpu, But Ci Doesn'T Have Gpu Node. I Run The Following Code With Tf Backend(Cpu Or Gpu) And Cntk Backend(Gpu), They Gives The Same Output.
Test Code:
```
From Keras.Layers Import Input, Conv2D
From Keras.Models Import Model
From Keras.Initializers Import Constant
Import Numpy As Np

Kernel = Np.Arange(9).Reshape((3, 3, 1, 1))
Print(Kernel.Shape)

Inputs = Input(Shape=(10, 10, 1))

This Idea Came When I Saw The Pr #10551. I Don'T Thing Doing Giant Prs Are A Good Thing. With This Setup, We Can Do One Pr Per File And Progressively Enable Line Checking On A Per File Basis.

For Example, If I Do A Pr Enabling E501 In `Docs/Autogen.Py`, Then, I Would Have To Modify Only Two Files:
* `Docs/Autogen.Py` To Make The Lines Shorter.
* `Pytest.Ini` To Remove The Corresponding Line And Avoid Any Future Regression.

Conveniently, Keras Uses`Os.Environ.Get('Omp_Num_Threads')` To Set `Intra_Op_Parallelism_Threads`.  I Think It Would Be Useful To Also Set `Inter_Op_Parallelism_Threads` Using This Variable.

This Is Convenient Because E.G. You Can Set `Omp_Num_Threads=1` And Keras Will Use No Multithreading.

It Allows Ctc Beam Search To Disable Merging Repeated Adjacent Symbols Even If They Are Separated By A Blank Symbol And Behave Consistently With Greedy Search. `K.Ctc_Decode()` Has A New Argument `Merge_Repeated=False` (Instead Of Hard-Coded Constant) Which Is Passed To Tf. A Test Is Included.

In Addition It Upgrades Deprecated Usage Of `Tf.Sparse_To_Dense()` In `K.Ctc_Decode()` (Tf Was Warning About It) And Fixes Some Doc Strings (Proper Case Of Boolean Values) There.

There'S A Separate Test, Since We Needed Different Data And To Make The Whole Test As Obvious As Possible. Possibly We Could Craft Such Data That Both Tests Can Be Merged And Parametrized.

I'Ve Encountered A Use-Case Where I In My Data Have A Columns Of Text, And A Column Consisting Of Lists Of Texts. Something Like This:

```Python
Col1 = ['Long Text Here', 'Other Long Text Here']
Col2 = [['Tags', 'In', 'Here'], ['Tags', 'Tags', 'Tags']]
```
Ideally I Could Use The Same Tokenizer, But This Is Currently A Hassle. This Pr Implements

1. The Ability To Call `Fit_On_Texts`, And `Texts_To_X` With List Of Lists As Arguments. Assuming Each Inner List To Consist Of Tokens.
2. Allow You To Run `Fit` Multiple Times.

I'Ve Already Wrote A Fix And I'Ll Post A Detailed Description Soon.

```
Valueerror: Shapes Must Be Equal Rank, But Are 2 And 1 For 'Assign_732' (Op: 'Assign') With Input Shapes: [2,384], [768].
```

Bias Is Not Converted From `Cudnngru` Shape (2*Units*Gates) To Cudnn-Compatible, `Gru(Reset_After=True` Shape (2, Units*Gates). The Reason That Nesting To Model Is Missing In `Keras.Topology.Saving.Preprocess_Weights_For_Loading()`.

We Can Do The Same As In The Block For Converting From Keras 1 Model.

In Addition `Weights[2]` Is H5 Dataset:

```
Biases = Weights[2].Reshape((2, -1) If From_Cudnn Else -1)
```

And Fails With:

```
'Dataset' Object Has No Attribute 'Reshape'

Fix Is:

Changed Plot_Model Function In Vis_Utils.Py To Fully Support Plotting Submodels And Also Fixed Some Bugs. Previous Pr [#11431](Https://Github.Com/Keras-Team/Keras/Pull/11431) Had Add Ability To Visualize Only Wrapped Submodels With Plot_Model Function, But It Works Wrong Sometimes, As Shown Below Later. This Pr Can Not Only Support Plotting Wrapped Submodels, But Also Add Ability To Plot Unwrapped Submodels. And It Doesn'T Get Wrong Results According To My Tests.

For Example, This Model Is From [Video Question Answering Model](Https://Keras.Io/Getting-Started/Functional-Api-Guide/#Video-Question-Answering-Model) In Keras Documentation.

```Python
From Keras.Layers Import Conv2D, Maxpooling2D, Flatten

Encoded_Frame_Sequence = Timedistributed(Vision_Model)(Video_Input)  # The Output Will Be A Sequence Of Vectors
Encoded_Video = Lstm(256)(Encoded_Frame_Sequence)  # The Output Will Be A Vector

# Define A Language Model To Encode The Question Into A Vector.
# Each Question Will Be At Most 100 Word Long,
# And We Will Index Words As Integers From 1 To 9999.
Question_Input = Input(Shape=(100,), Dtype='Int32')
Embedded_Question = Embedding(Input_Dim=10000, Output_Dim=256, Input_Length=100)(Question_Input)
Encoded_Question = Lstm(256)(Embedded_Question)

# This Is A Model-Level Representation Of The Question Encoder
Question_Encoder = Model(Inputs=Question_Input, Outputs=Encoded_Question)

# Let'S Use It To Encode The Question:
Video_Question_Input = Input(Shape=(100,), Dtype='Int32')
Encoded_Video_Question = Question_Encoder(Video_Question_Input)

# And This Is Our Video Question Answering Model:
Merged = Keras.Layers.Concatenate([Encoded_Video, Encoded_Video_Question])
Output = Dense(1000, Activation='Softmax')(Merged)
Video_Qa_Model = Model(Inputs=[Video_Input, Video_Question_Input], Outputs=Output)
```

Calling Plot_Model Without Parameter ```Expand_Nested``` Will Produce:
```Python
Plot_Model(Video_Qa_Model, To_File=""Model.Png"", Show_Shapes=True)
```
![Model_New_Not_Expand](Https://User-Images.Githubusercontent.Com/42084654/56105055-1763C800-5F6D-11E9-98B7-19B2A3042B50.Png)

Calling Plot_Model With Parameter ```Expand_Nested=True``` Will Produce The Picture Below. As We Can See, It Plotted Both Wrapped Submodels And Unwrapped Submodels, I.E., Time_Distributed_1(Sequential_1) And Model_1.

```Python

However, Calling The Same With Previous Pr Will Produce Something Wrong As Below. First, It Can'T Plot Unwrapped Models; Second, It  Even Got Wrong Model Structure, Which Is The Bug We Talked Before.

1) The `Get_Function_Signature` In `Autogen.Py` Duplicates Module Name For Non-Method Functions. For Example, It Returns `Keras.Preprocessing.Sequence.Keras.Preprocessing.Sequence.Pad_Sequences` Instead Of `Keras.Preprocessing.Sequence.Pad_Sequences`.

2) Method Functions And Non-Method Functions Should Be Distinguished From Each Other. Since, The Module Name Of Non-Method Functions Should Be Included In The Signature In The Docs (Like `Keras.Preprocessing.Sequence.Pad_Sequences(...)`) Whereas For The Methods Of Classes It Should Not Be Included (Like `Compile(...)` For `Sequential` Class). Therefore, A New `'Methods'` Key Is Introduced To Make This Distinction.

The Current Implementation Of Earlystopping Monitors A User-Specified Quantity, And Stops Training After [Patience] Epochs Have Passed Since The Last Best Value Of The Monitored Quantity.

In The **Current** Implementation, The Final Model Weights Are Those At The End Of The Patience Period.

In The **Proposed** Implementation, The Final Model Weights Are Those From The Epoch With The Best Value Of The Monitored Quantity, In Agreement With The Original Paper [1] As Well As [2].

The Proposed Implementation Includes An Additional Test Case (Test_Earlystopping_Final_Weights) In Test_Callbacks.Py; It Also Makes Two Existing Test Cases (Test_Earlystopping_Patience And Test_Earlystopping_Baseline) Compatible With The Proposed Implementation.

**Caveat**: Inputs Tensors Must Have A Static Batch Size. This Limitation Does Not Exist In `Tf.Keras`. Lifting This Limitation In Multi-Backend Keras Is Doable But Fairly Involved. First We Need All Backends To Implement `Placeholder_With_Default`. That Part Is Relatively Straightforward (By Using Regular Placeholders And Feeding The Default If A Value Is Not Provided, At The Level Of `K.Function`), But Will Take A Bit Of Work. Then We Need To Switch The Sample Weight Placeholders To Be Placeholders With Default Values Of 1.

### Summary
`Weighted_Metrics` Were Not Being Properly Serialized During Saving Or Examined-For During Loading. This Patch Adds `Weighted_Metrics` To `Training_Config`, And Seeks `Weighted_Metrics` When Constructing A Model From A H5. A `Get` Is Used Instead Of Standard `__Getitem__` Because Older Versions Of Keras Would Lack This Field In `Training_Config` And Then Fail On Load.

```Batchnormalization``` Layer, Mean/Var/Beta/Gama Tensors May Be [Broadcast](Https://Github.Com/Keras-Team/Keras/Blob/Master/Keras/Layers/Normalization.Py#L140). 
```
Input = Input(Shape=(3, 1001, 1001), Dtype='Float32')
X = Conv2D(Filters=64, Kernel_Size=(3, 3), Strides=1, Padding='Same')(Input)
X = Batchnormalization(Axis=1)(X)
```
In The Above Example, As You Set ```Axis=1```, The Mean/Var/Beta/Gama Tensors Would Be Reshaped As [1,64,1,1]. For Tf Backend, It Will Try To Call The Optimized ```Tf.Nn.Fused_Batch_Norm``` If Possible. But ```Tf.Nn.Fused_Batch_Norm``` Only Accept Mean/Var/Beta/Gama As 1 Dimension Tensor, We Need To Squeeze Them Ahead.
Actually We Have Did Same Preprocessing For [Cntk Backend](Https://Github.Com/Keras-Team/Keras/Blob/Master/Keras/Backend/Cntk_Backend.Py#L1070).

Note: This Bug Should Only Happened When Tf-Gpu As Backend, Since Tf-Cpu Fusedbatchnorm Doesn'T Support Nchw Format, And It Will Fall Back To The Default ```Tf.Nn.Batch_Normalization```.

@Taehoonlee 

Allow Me To Propose An Alternative To The `Assert_Value_With_Ref` Method For The Numpy Reference Operations.
The Limitation Which I See With This Approach Is That It Will Be Hard To Track The Progress Of The Removal Of The Other Backends (I May Be Wrong, Feel Free To Correct Me It'S Possible I Haven'T Read The Code Well Enough).

I Propose That We Consider The Numpy Backend As A True Backend For The Tests (Without Gradients Of Course).
I Created A New Variable Called `Backend_And_Np` Which Is Similar To `Backends` And Will Hopefully Replace It.

Once We Manage To Remove All Occurences Of `Kc`, `Ktf`, `Kth` And `Backends`, We Should Be Able To Removed Unnecessary Installs Of Backends.

I Made A Small Example Here For The `Reshape` Backend Function.

What Are Your Thoughts On This?

With Reccurent Layer Output Of The Model Can Be `[Num_Samples, Timesteps, Output_Dim]`, But In The `Sparse_Categorical_Accuracy` For `Y_True` Values `Flatten` Is Used. That Creates A Bug Like ""Incompatible Shapes: [80] Vs. [16,5]"" (If Timesteps=16 And Output_Dim=5).
Bug Fixed By Adding `Flatten` To `K.Cast(K.Argmax(Y_Pred, Axis=-1), K.Floatx()))` Too.

- Making sure there is no code between functions declarations, this is easy to miss and unexpected. Logic should be put in functions or in `if __name__ == '__main__':`.
- Raise an error when users are not building the docs with the tensorflow backend to avoid them wondering why this is not working. The docstrings are only present in `tensorflow_backend.py`.

This Pr Is An Update Of #7617. Credit Goes To @Sameermanek For His Work.

### Related Issues

### Pr Overview

**This Pr Is Backward Compatible** 

A New Argument Has Been Added To The Constructor Of The Tensorboard Callback. Here Is The Description That I Added In The Docs:

>Write_Step: 
`'Batch'` Or `'Epoch'` Or Integer. When Using `'Batch'`, Writes
            The Losses And Metrics To Tensorboard After Each Batch. The Same
            Applies For `'Epoch'`. If Using An Integer, Let'S Say `10000`,
            The Callback Will Write The Metrics And Losses To Tensorboard Every
            10000 Samples. Note That Writing Too Frequently To Tensorboard
            Can Slow Down Your Training.

Added Two New Optional Arguments To `Plot_Model` Function In `Vis_Utils.Py`, To Be Able To Visualize Nested (Wrapped) Models. Also Adds `Dpi` Param To Have Ability To Produce High Resolution Graphs.

For Example Giving This Model:
```Python
Sentence_Input = Input(Shape=(2, 3), Dtype='Float32', Name=""Input2"")
L_Lstm = Bidirectional(Lstm(16))(Sentence_Input)
Sent_Encoder = Model(Sentence_Input, L_Lstm)
Review_Input = Input(Shape=(5, 2, 3), Dtype='Float32')
Review_Encoder = Timedistributed(Sent_Encoder)(Review_Input)
L_Lstm_Sent = Lstm(16)(Review_Encoder)
Preds = Dense(5, Activation='Softmax')(L_Lstm_Sent)
Model = Model(Review_Input, Preds)
Vis_Utils.Plot_Model(Model, To_File='Model3.Png', Show_Shapes=True,
                     Expand_Nested=True, Dpi=300)
```
Will Produce:

While Calling It Without New Arguments Will Produce Plot As Before:
```Python
Vis_Utils.Plot_Model(Model, To_File='Model3.Png', Show_Shapes=True)
```

Currently We Have 2 Types Of Models (`Sequential`, `Model`) And 25+ Types Of Layers.
In The Tests, We Test Each Type Of Layer In Each Type Of Model.
But `Sequential` Derives From `Model`, So In Fact, If Layers Work In `Model` They'Re Expected To Work In `Sequential`. 

The Effect Of This Pr Is That It Halves The Running Time Of The Layer Tests In All Backends (See The Logs).

* Fix shape mismatch in `rnn()` of tensorflow_backend

Fix the shape mismatch in `rnn()` with `not unroll` and `mask is not None` of the Tensorflow backend.

Problem: If the rnn cell has any (recurrent) `states[i]` whose shape is different from that of the `output` (`states[0]`), there will raise an `ValueError` when updating that state.

Reason: This is because the `tiled_mask_t` is not updated correctly for each `states[i]` but instead is simply copied from that of the `output` (`states[0]`).

Solution: Tile the `mask_t` with the correct shape of each `states[i]`. Notice that in a similar situation with `unroll is True`, the `tiled_mask_t` is handled correctly.

@Taehoonlee 

Allow Me To Propose An Alternative To The `Assert_Value_With_Ref` Method For The Numpy Reference Operations.
The Limitation Which I See With This Approach Is That It Will Be Hard To Track The Progress Of The Removal Of The Other Backends (I May Be Wrong, Feel Free To Correct Me It'S Possible I Haven'T Read The Code Well Enough).

I Propose That We Consider The Numpy Backend As A True Backend For The Tests (Without Gradients Of Course).
I Created A New Variable Called `Backend_And_Np` Which Is Similar To `Backends` And Will Hopefully Replace It.

Once We Manage To Remove All Occurences Of `Kc`, `Ktf`, `Kth` And `Backends`, We Should Be Able To Removed Unnecessary Installs Of Backends.

I Made A Small Example Here For The `Reshape` Backend Function.

What Are Your Thoughts On This?

This Pr Resolves Two Issues:
1) The `Get_Function_Signature` In `Autogen.Py` Duplicates Module Name For Non-Method Functions. For Example, It Returns `Keras.Preprocessing.Sequence.Keras.Preprocessing.Sequence.Pad_Sequences` Instead Of `Keras.Preprocessing.Sequence.Pad_Sequences`.

2) Method Functions And Non-Method Functions Should Be Distinguished From Each Other. Since, The Module Name Of Non-Method Functions Should Be Included In The Signature In The Docs (Like `Keras.Preprocessing.Sequence.Pad_Sequences(...)`) Whereas For The Methods Of Classes It Should Not Be Included (Like `Compile(...)` For `Sequential` Class). Therefore, A New `'Methods'` Key Is Introduced To Make This Distinction.

### Summary
Conveniently, Keras Uses`Os.Environ.Get('Omp_Num_Threads')` To Set `Intra_Op_Parallelism_Threads`.  I Think It Would Be Useful To Also Set `Inter_Op_Parallelism_Threads` Using This Variable.

This Is Convenient Because E.G. You Can Set `Omp_Num_Threads=1` And Keras Will Use No Multithreading.

keras,1,#11808,1336cdb14ff03de754aec6899794742ca91057b2,"Sync The Callback Api With New Tf.Keras Api### Summary
This Pr Syncs Callback Api With [The New `Tf.Keras` Api](Https://Github.Com/Tensorflow/Tensorflow/Blob/Master/Tensorflow/Python/Keras/Callbacks.Py#L175).

Modifications:
- A New Helper Function, `_Call_Batch_Hook`, Has Been Introduced To Handle Batch-Related Callbacks Methods In Different Modes (Train/Test/Prediction).
- `On_Batch_End` And `On_Batch_Begin` Has Been Refactored To Call `_Call_Batch_Hook` Instead.
- Methods `On_Train_Batch_Begin` And `On_Train_Batch_End` Have Been Introduced Specifically For Callbacks Batch-Related Methods In Training Mode.

I Have Also Done Some Small Formatting And Style Fixes.

Further, I Must Mention That I Think There Is A Small Error In Tf Implementation: [In This Line](Https://Github.Com/Tensorflow/Tensorflow/Blob/320Dc4913F94A679790D90F5C577037276Aa9599/Tensorflow/Python/Keras/Callbacks.Py#L187) The `_T_Enter_Batch` Attribute, Which Measure The Batch Processing Time, Is Set At The Beginning Of The Method. However, I Think This Is Wrong (Since In That Case The Execution Time Of `On_Batch_Begin` Would Also Be Included) And As It Is [Currently Implemented In Keras](Https://Github.Com/Keras-Team/Keras/Blob/7Bee9A18D83899Ce6Dfd50C4883Afc678139F4Ad/Keras/Callbacks.Py#L99), It Must Be Done At The End Of The Method. So In This Pr I Would Set This Attribute At The End.

keras,1,#10242,a3664246de4bb8ef3232dd84ff47fc2694c69e58,"Handle `Mask` In `Timedistributed` Wrapper.This Pr Aims To Add Proper Support Of `Mask` In `Timedistributed` Wrapper Layer. Several Previous Prs Have Raised Questions About This Or Have Attempted To Solve It, But I Didn'T Find Any Perfect Solution So Far. I May Not Be Able To Have A Perfect One Either But Am Willing To Improve It. The Most Frequent Usage Of Such Layers With Masking Support Might Be A Hierarchical Rnn On A Sentence With Words With Characters, Or A Paragraph With Sentences With Words. (E.G., Models Like [This](Https://Github.Com/Keras-Team/Keras/Blob/Master/Examples/Mnist_Hierarchical_Rnn.Py)).

Here Are The Main Ideas/Purposes Of This Pr:

1) For Layers Like `Timedistributed(Embedding(..., Mask_Zero=True))` Or `Timedistributed(Masking(...))`, The Layer Should Call `Compute_Mask()` At Each Time Step And Stack Them.
2) For Layers Like `Timedistributed(Lstm(...))`, The `Input_Mask` Should Be Split And Fed Into The `Lstm` Layer At Each Time Step. And If The `Output_Shape` Changes (E.G., `Return_Sequences=False` In `Lstm`), The `Output_Mask` Of The `Timedistributed` Layer Should Also Change Correspondingly.
3) The `Timedistributed` Layer Should Support, E.G., `Input_Shape=(None, None)`. For Example, The Number Of Words In A Sentence And The Number Of Characters In A Word Can Be Different From Sample To Sample. Currently The `Timedistributed` Can Only Support One Unspecified Input Dimension.

Here Are Some Details Of This Pr To Discuss, Which Might Have Better Solutions:
1) `K.Int_Shape()` May Not Be Available For Some `Mask` With `Theano` Backend, Especially When The Inner Layer Is `Embedding` Or `Masking`. This Is Because `_Keras_Shape` Is Not Set In Lots Of Operations In `Theano_Backend` If The Tensor Shape Is Not Changed. I Manually Create The `_Keras_Shape` In `Compute_Mask` Of These Two Layers.
2) When `Input_Shape[0] Is Not None` In `Timedistributed` Layer, We Need To Use `K.Rnn()` To Dynamically Call The Inner Layer. Because `K.Rnn()` Can Only Take 1 Tensor Input But We Need To Feed Both `Input` And `Mask`, I Didn'T Do Anything In This Situation. Probably We Can Pass All `Mask` As Constants To `K.Rnn()` But I Was Expecting Better Solutions.
3) If There'S `None` From The Output Of `K.Int_Shape`, We Need To Replace It By The Output From `K.Shape`, So That `Reshape` Can Be Correctly Called.

The Generation Of The Parameters Happens In `Get_Random_Transform()` Function Which Outputs A Dictionary Of Transformation Parameters Randomly Chosen. The Transform Can Then Be Applied In A New `Apply_Transform()` Function.

My Aim Is To Eventually Enable More Generalized Usage For Imagedatagenerator; For Example, Transformation Of Segmentation Coordinates In An Image Segmentation Problem Along With The Image Itself. Since This Is Going To Be Quite A Big Upgrade, I'M Doing It In Smaller Steps At A Time To Be Sure Not To Break Anything Too Horribly. This Refactorization Is The First Step.

Some Design Choices I Have Made Here:

* Representing A Transformation As A Dictionary Of Transformation Parameters And Values Corresponding To Each Of Them. Other Choice Would Be Just A List Or Tuple Of The Values, But I Think This Way Is More Generalizable In The Future If We Want E.G. Custom Transformation Functions (For Image Segmentation Coordinates)

* Keeping All The Old Functions (`Random_Transform()` For Instance) Even Though They Are Not Strictly Needed. This Is Not To Break Any Existing Functionality Anywhere Else. Now The Old Functions Just Call The New Functions.

To Elaborate On My Future Vision On The Imagedatagenerator: My Plan Is That Eventually It Would Be Able To Process A List Of Inputs And A List Of Outputs, Some Of Which Might Be Images And Some Which Might Be Something Else. It Would Also Take, As A Constructor Parameter, A List Of Transformations That Need To Applied To Each Of The Inputs And Outputs. The Manner In Which A Given Transformation Acts On A Given Type Of Input Is Specified By Giving Separate Set Of Transformation Functions For Each Input/Output. Some Of Them Can Be In-Build (E.G. What We Have Now) Or User Defined.

Valueerror: The Name ""Nested"" Is Used 2 Times In The Model. All Layer Names Should Be Unique.
```

The Problem Is Caused By [Line 237](Https://Github.Com/Keras-Team/Keras/Blob/Master/Keras/Utils/Multi_Gpu_Utils.Py#L237) On Current Implementation Of `Multi_Gpu_Model()`. The Values Of `Model.Output_Names` Can Be Non-Unique And Thus We Get Valueerror Exceptions. The Pr Handles This Case By Choosing Unique Names For The Outputs That Have Conflicts. 

Example: In The Above Snippet The `Siamese.Output_Names` Has Value `['Add_1', 'Nested', 'Nested']`. To Avoid Duplicate Layer Names The Proposed Code Will Update `Parallel_Siamese.Output_Names` Value To `['Add_1', 'Nested_1', 'Nested_2']`.

With Reccurent Layer Output Of The Model Can Be `[Num_Samples, Timesteps, Output_Dim]`, But In The `Sparse_Categorical_Accuracy` For `Y_True` Values `Flatten` Is Used. That Creates A Bug Like ""Incompatible Shapes: [80] Vs. [16,5]"" (If Timesteps=16 And Output_Dim=5).

For Detailed Discussion Consider Referring To The Issue #11217 

Overview:
In Version 2.2.2 Of Keras Building Model Without Specifying `Input_Shape` Or `Batch_Input_Shape` Is Allowed But For Such Cases, The Model Will Not Be Actually Built Implicitly And You Need To Build The Model Explicitly Either By Calling `Model.Build()` Or Else `Model.Fit()` On Some Data. If You Call `Model.Summary()` Before Building The Model It Will Give A ""Model Not Built"" Error But The Possible Solutions To Such Error Are

1. Add `Input_Shape` Or `Batch_Input_Size` In The First Layer
2. Call `Model.Build()` Before `Model.Summary()`
3. Call `Model.Fit()` On Some Data Before `Model.Summary()`

But The Previous Error Message Was Only Suggesting Solution 3 Which Seems Unintutive. 

So I Have Rewritten The Error Message To Suggest All Three Possible Solutions

Adding Code To The Initialization Function Of `Hdf5Matrix` So That `.Dtype` And `.Shape` Reflect The Actual Values Returned By The Normalizer.

For Example, The New Imagedatagenerator Page Does Not Document The Imagedatagenerator Methods (Fit, Flow, ...) Anymore, We Only Have Some Examples.
This Pr Adds:

- Support For Automatic Generation Of Class Methods: The Classes Marked As ""Classes_With_Methods"" In The Autogen.Py File Will Now Have All Their Methods (Obviously Not The Private Or The Excluded Ones) Fully Documented
- Some Style Enrichments In Order To Make The Doc Clearer: 
  - The Documented Class Methods Will Have A ""Method"" Prepended To Their Name: This Helps Distinguish Between A Method And A Module Function . 
  - All The Classes Will Have A ""Class"" Prepended To Their Name. This Names Are Added Using Js And So They Will Not Pollute The Menu Bar.

I Tried To Follow A Style Similar To The One Already Adopted By The Tensorflow'S Docs.
In Particular:

- I Decided To Add An Additional Custom Label, ""Classes_With_Methods"" In Order To Be Able To Decided For Which Class Generate The Inner Methods Docs. At Them Moment, Only The Imagedatagenerator Class Uses It
- I Decided To Add The ""Class"" Prefix To The Class Names In Order To Make Easier To Distinguish Them From Simple And Plain Methods
- The Solution Makes Uses Of Some Tricks In Order To Add The Style. I Decided To Go For Them Instead Of Using Some Extensions (Like For Example Pymdownx.Extra) That Would Have Make The Generation More Cumbersome. 

All These Decisions Can Obviously Be Changed And Improved But I Think Pr Could Serve As A Good Base For Future Improvements. I Have Tested The Docs On A Mac And It Is Rendered Wonderfully.

### How To Test
Except The Unit Test I Added, I Also Run The Following Test. As Dilated Transposed Convolution Is Equivalent To Standard Transposed Convolution With Upsampled Kernels With Effective Size ```Kernel_Size + (Kernel_Size - 1) * (Dilation_Rate - 1)``` , Produced By Inserting ```Dilation_Rate - 1``` Zeros Along Consecutive Elements Across The Kernel' Spatial Dimensions. The Following Code Verify These Two Scenarios That Give The Same Output:
* Kernel_Size = 2, Dilation_Rate = 2
* Kernel_Size = 3, Kernel Is Built From The Above Kernel And Insert Zeros Along Consecutive Elements.

            The Raw Image Data Or A Url Or Filename To Load The Data From.
            This Always Results In Embedded Image Data.
        Url : Unicode
            A Url To Download The Data From. If You Specify `Url=`,
            The Image Data Will Not Be Embedded Unless You Also Specify `Embed=True`.
        Filename : Unicode
            Path To A Local File To Load The Data From.
            Images From A File Are Always Embedded.
        Format : Unicode
            The Format Of The Image Data (Png/Jpeg/Jpg/Gif). If A Filename Or Url Is Given
            For Format Will Be Inferred From The Filename Extension.
        Embed : Bool
            Should The Image Data Be Embedded Using A Data Uri (True) Or Be
            Loaded Using An <Img> Tag. Set This To True If You Want The Image
            To Be Viewable Later With No Internet Connection In The Notebook.
    
            Default Is `True`, Unless The Keyword Argument `Url` Is Set, Then
            Default Value Is `False`.
    
            Note That Qtconsole Is Not Able To Display Images If `Embed` Is Set To `False`
        Width : Int

            Automatically Set The Width And Height To Half Of The Measured

            This Only Works For Embedded Images Because It Reads The Width/Height
            From Image Data.
            For Non-Embedded Images, You Can Just Set The Desired Display Width
            And Height Directly.
        Unconfined: Bool
            Set Unconfined=True To Disable Max-Width Confinement Of The Image.

To Solve The Issue Of Cyclical Imports, I Moved The `Normalized_Data_Format` In `Backend/Common.Py`.

In A Recent Change To Keras (#11133) Incorporated In 2.2.3, `Name` Was Added To The Sequential Config. From The Release Notes:

> **Breaking Changes**
> Modify The Return Value Of Sequential.Get_Config(). Previously, The Return Value Was A List Of The Config Dictionaries Of The Layers Of The Model. Now, The Return Value Is A Dictionary With Keys Layers, Name, And An Optional Key Build_Input_Shape. The Old Config Is Equivalent To New_Config['Layers']. This Makes The Output Of Get_Config Consistent Across All Model Classes.

However, Keras Now Raises An `Unboundlocalerror` Exception Whenever Loading A Legacy Configuration File. In `From_Config`, `Name` Can Be Undefined If This Variable Is Not Present In The Config, And In Line 298 Of The Modified File, Is Used By `Model = Cls(Name=Name)`.

I Modified The Code Such That Legacy Configs Still Load, But Throws A Warning. Maybe A Different Behavior Is Desired, But Keras, In My Opinion, Shouldn'T Crash Like This (Especially Without Any Warnings).

### Summary

The keras examples are great, but do not benefit from a good visibility. I believe we could add them to the docs. It requires very little work since all the code and docstrings have already been written.

Keras Plot_Model With ```Expand_Nested=True``` Does Not Work If There Are Multiple Submodels With The Same Nesting Level.

Let'S Take A Slightly Modified Version From Unit Tests (Https://Github.Com/Keras-Team/Keras/Blob/Master/Tests/Keras/Utils/Vis_Utils_Test.Py#L31-L40) As An Example:
```Python
    Inner_Input = Input(Shape=(2, 3), Dtype='Float32', Name='Inner_Input')
    Inner_Lstm = Bidirectional(Lstm(16, Name='Inner_Lstm'), Name='Bd')(Inner_Input)
    Encoder = Model(Inner_Input, Inner_Lstm, Name='Encoder_Model')
    Inner_Input2 = Input(Shape=(2, 3), Dtype='Float32', Name='Inner_Input2')
    Inner_Lstm2 = Bidirectional(Lstm(16, Name='Inner_Lstm2'), Name='Bd')(Inner_Input2)
    Encoder2 = Model(Inner_Input2, Inner_Lstm2, Name='Encoder_Model2')
    Outer_Input = Input(Shape=(5, 2, 3), Dtype='Float32', Name='Input')
    Outer_Input2 = Input(Shape=(5, 2, 3), Dtype='Float32', Name='Input2')
    Inner_Encoder = Timedistributed(Encoder, Name='Td_Encoder')(Outer_Input)
    Inner_Encoder2 = Timedistributed(Encoder2, Name='Td_Encoder2')(Outer_Input2)
    Lstm = Lstm(16, Name='Outer_Lstm')(Concatenate([Inner_Encoder, Inner_Encoder2]))
    Preds = Dense(5, Activation='Softmax', Name='Predictions')(Lstm)
    Model = Model([Outer_Input, Outer_Input2], Preds)
    Vis_Utils.Plot_Model(Model, To_File='Model3.Png', Show_Shapes=True,
                         Expand_Nested=True, Dpi=300)
