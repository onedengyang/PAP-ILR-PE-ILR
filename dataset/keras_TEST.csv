Python Reads The `Pythonhashseed` Environment Variable Upon Startup, So It'S No Use Setting It From Within The Program.
It'S Also Worth Mentioning Reproducibility Issues When Using The Tensorflow Backend On A Gpu. I Just Recommend Running On The Cpu If You Need Perfect Reproducibility.

This Condition Is Never Hit In `Layer_Test`. I Added An `Assert False` And Ran The Test Suite Locally To Check It.

I Don'T Know What Was Intended With This Check, But It Seems That This Should Not Be Performed On Each Layer Because It Does Not Depend On The Implementation Of The Layer.

Unfortunately, According To [This](Https://Www.Mkdocs.Org/User-Guide/Writing-Your-Docs/), It Seems That Table Cells Cannot Span Multiple Lines In Markdown. In Addition, The Pep8 Tests Fail With Long Lines So I Tried To Make It Concise But Clear.
The 'Settings: ' Lines Were Moved Under The Tables Because This Way They'Ll Be Close To The Tables The Settings Refer To And Act Similar To A Caption. If The Lines Were Above The Tables, There Was A Big Gap Between The Table Header And The Setting Description.
Finally, The 'Benchmark ...' Line Was Changed From A Heading To Regular Bold Text As The Long Line Was Showing In The Sidebar On The Left.

If This Formatting Is Undesirable, Another Option Would Be To Keep The Old Formatting For The Tables And Wrap Them In Code Blocks.

Support Loading And Saving (Models And Weights) To/From Any Binary Stream (File-Like Object):

_Note: As Opposed To Other Pr:S With ""Saving To Binary"" In The Title, This Pr Goes One Step Further And Extends The Api To Write And Load Directly To File-Like Objects, Thus Making It Possible To Also Load Models From Binary Data (Without First Having To Store It On Disk)._

This Is Usefull Since It Is The Most General Kind Of Serialization (See This Request Https://Github.Com/Keras-Team/Keras/Issues/9343) And Allows Saving/Loading Models In Environments Where We Don'T Have Disk Access Such As Colab (See Https://Github.Com/Keras-Team/Keras/Pull/11636#Discussion_R234426668).

#### Examples
Saving Binary:
```
With Open(Fname, 'Wb') As Raw_File:
    Save_Model(Model, Raw_File)
With H5Py.File(Fname, Mode='R') As H5File:
    Loaded_Model = Load_Model(H5File)
```
Loading Binary:
```
With H5Py.File(Fname, Mode='W') As H5File:
    Save_Model(Model, H5File)
With Open(Fname, 'Rb') As Raw_File:
    Loaded_Model = Load_Model(Raw_File)
```
Or Both - Fully In Memory:
```
Stream = Io.Bytesio()
Save_Model(Model, Stream)
Stream.Seek(0)
Loaded_Model = Load_Model(Stream)
```

This Pr Fixed This Bug In ```Conv1D, Conv2D, Conv3D, Conv2Dtranspose```. For Other Conv Layers, It Has Several Other Issues Should Be Fixed As Well, I'Ll Send Follow-Up Prs Later.
I Found Related Unit Tests Only Run Cases That The Number Of Channels Is 1.

Unfortunately, According To [This](Https://Www.Mkdocs.Org/User-Guide/Writing-Your-Docs/), It Seems That Table Cells Cannot Span Multiple Lines In Markdown. In Addition, The Pep8 Tests Fail With Long Lines So I Tried To Make It Concise But Clear.
The 'Settings: ' Lines Were Moved Under The Tables Because This Way They'Ll Be Close To The Tables The Settings Refer To And Act Similar To A Caption. If The Lines Were Above The Tables, There Was A Big Gap Between The Table Header And The Setting Description.
Finally, The 'Benchmark ...' Line Was Changed From A Heading To Regular Bold Text As The Long Line Was Showing In The Sidebar On The Left.

If This Formatting Is Undesirable, Another Option Would Be To Keep The Old Formatting For The Tables And Wrap Them In Code Blocks.

_________________________________________________________________

```
The Output Shape Should Be ```(None, 6, 6, 1)``` According Keras Shape Inference, But It'S ```(1, 4, 4, 1)``` After Evaluation. This Is Because It Passed ```Dilation_Rate``` To ```Strides``` By Mistake At Cntk Backend When ```Dilation > 2```. 

### How To Test This Fix
There Is ```Test_Convolution_2D``` In ```Convolutional_Test.Py```, But I Still Skip It Due To Cntk Only Supports Dilated Convolution On Gpu, But Ci Doesn'T Have Gpu Node. I Run The Following Code With Tf Backend(Cpu Or Gpu) And Cntk Backend(Gpu), They Gives The Same Output.
Test Code:
```
From Keras.Layers Import Input, Conv2D
From Keras.Models Import Model
From Keras.Initializers Import Constant
Import Numpy As Np

Kernel = Np.Arange(9).Reshape((3, 3, 1, 1))
Print(Kernel.Shape)

Inputs = Input(Shape=(10, 10, 1))
M = Conv2D(1, Kernel_Size=(3,3), Padding='Valid', Dilation_Rate=(2, 2), Kernel_Initializer=Constant(Kernel))(Inputs)
Model = Model(Inputs=Inputs, Outputs=M)
Model.Summary()


X = Np.Arange(100).Reshape((1, 10, 10, 1)).Astype(Np.Float32) 
Y = Model.Predict(X)

```
Output:

@Taehoonlee 

Allow Me To Propose An Alternative To The `Assert_Value_With_Ref` Method For The Numpy Reference Operations.
The Limitation Which I See With This Approach Is That It Will Be Hard To Track The Progress Of The Removal Of The Other Backends (I May Be Wrong, Feel Free To Correct Me It'S Possible I Haven'T Read The Code Well Enough).

I Propose That We Consider The Numpy Backend As A True Backend For The Tests (Without Gradients Of Course).
I Created A New Variable Called `Backend_And_Np` Which Is Similar To `Backends` And Will Hopefully Replace It.

Once We Manage To Remove All Occurences Of `Kc`, `Ktf`, `Kth` And `Backends`, We Should Be Able To Removed Unnecessary Installs Of Backends.

I Made A Small Example Here For The `Reshape` Backend Function.

What Are Your Thoughts On This?

keras,1,#11280,b80f3bd3a227d837790395378b14150dd11e02b7,"Gracefully Handle Legacy Sequential Configs### Summary

In A Recent Change To Keras (#11133) Incorporated In 2.2.3, `Name` Was Added To The Sequential Config. From The Release Notes:

> **Breaking Changes**
> Modify The Return Value Of Sequential.Get_Config(). Previously, The Return Value Was A List Of The Config Dictionaries Of The Layers Of The Model. Now, The Return Value Is A Dictionary With Keys Layers, Name, And An Optional Key Build_Input_Shape. The Old Config Is Equivalent To New_Config['Layers']. This Makes The Output Of Get_Config Consistent Across All Model Classes.

However, Keras Now Raises An `Unboundlocalerror` Exception Whenever Loading A Legacy Configuration File. In `From_Config`, `Name` Can Be Undefined If This Variable Is Not Present In The Config, And In Line 298 Of The Modified File, Is Used By `Model = Cls(Name=Name)`.

I Modified The Code Such That Legacy Configs Still Load, But Throws A Warning. Maybe A Different Behavior Is Desired, But Keras, In My Opinion, Shouldn'T Crash Like This (Especially Without Any Warnings).
