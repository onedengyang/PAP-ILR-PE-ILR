The Problem Is, If  `Inbound_Layer_Name` Is Not In `Created_Layers`, It Will Never Be Because We Don'T Modify The `Created_Layers` (Last Time This Variable Was Modified Was At Line 1019 When We Called `Process_Layer`).

This Is Very Dangerous Because It Can Tranform A Simple Keras Bug (`Keyerror`) Into An Infinite Loop.

Fix #11106 .
```Run_Metadata``` And ```Options``` As ```Session_Kwargs``` Of ```K.Function``` Don'T Take Effect Since Keras 2.2. This Is Because We Don'T Pass In These Two Arguments To Either  ```Session._Make_Callable_From_Options ```(Tf >= 1.8) Or ```Session.Run```(Tf < 1.8).
I Searched And Found Similar Issues In ```Tf.Keras```, And Referred Https://Github.Com/Tensorflow/Tensorflow/Pull/19932 To Fix It.

### Summary

According To [Numpy Nep 19 — Random Number Generator Policy](Https://Www.Numpy.Org/Neps/Nep-0019-Rng-Policy.Html), Instantiating Local `Randomstate` Objects Is Preferred, Rather Than Seeding The Global `Np.Random` Generator.

Seeding The Global Generator May Introduce Unexpected Behavior In The Applications That Use Keras And Also Rely On Its State.

Proposed Change: Use A Local `Randomstate` Object In Dataset Loaders And The Orthogonal Initializer.

keras,1,#10664,aab55e649c34f8a24f00ee63922d049d3417c979,"Fix Redundant Functions' Module Names In Auto-Gen Docs### Summary
This Pr Fixes The Redundant Function Module Names In Auto-Gen Docs. Currently, The Module Name Of Functions (Those Which Are Not Methods Of A Class) Is Repeated Two Times In Documentation. [For Example](Https://Keras.Io/Preprocessing/Sequence/#Pad_Sequences):
> `Keras.Preprocessing.Sequence.Keras.Preprocessing.Sequence.Pad_Sequences`

Which Should Be: `Keras.Preprocessing.Sequence.Pad_Sequences`.
Further, This Pr Also Removes From The Docs The (Wrong) Module Name Of Methods Of Classes Like `Imagedatagenerator`. For Example, [This Is For `Apply_Transform`](Https://Keras.Io/Preprocessing/Image/#Apply_Transform):

> `Keras.Preprocessing.Image.Apply_Transform` 

Which Should Simply Be `Apply_Transform`, First Because It Is The Method Of A Class (I.E. `Imagedatagenerator`) And Second Because The Referenced Module Name Is Wrong (And This [Has Caused Confusion](Https://Stackoverflow.Com/Q/51311062/2099607)).

All Of This Were Caused By The Fact That `Clean_Module_Name()` Was Not Called On The `Function.__Module__` In `Render_Function` (Therefore This Mostly Affects The Docs For `Keras.Preprocessing` And `Keras.Applications`). Plus, The Way `Autogen.Py` Works, The Module Name Is Repeated Two Times In The Signature, But For The Non-Method Functions It Should Be Removed Only Once (That'S Why I Have Added A Condition).

","Fix signature of functions and methods in generated docs (#10743)

### Summary
This PR resolves two issues:
1) The `get_function_signature` in `autogen.py` duplicates module name for non-method functions. For example, it returns `keras.preprocessing.sequence.keras.preprocessing.sequence.pad_sequences` instead of `keras.preprocessing.sequence.pad_sequences`.

2) Method functions and non-method functions should be distinguished from each other. Since, the module name of non-method functions should be included in the signature in the docs (like `keras.preprocessing.sequence.pad_sequences(...)`) whereas for the methods of classes it should not be included (like `compile(...)` for `Sequential` class). Therefore, a new `'methods'` key is introduced to make this distinction.

Note that I temporary resolved the first issue by a merged PR (#10664); however that PR did not address the underlying problem.

With H5Py.File(Fname, Mode='R') As H5File:

This PR fixes the redundant function module names in auto-gen docs. Currently, the module name of functions (those which are not methods of a class) is repeated two times in documentation. [For example](https://keras.io/preprocessing/sequence/#pad_sequences):
> `keras.preprocessing.sequence.keras.preprocessing.sequence.pad_sequences`

which should be: `keras.preprocessing.sequence.pad_sequences`.
Further, this PR also removes from the docs the (wrong) module name of methods of classes like `ImageDataGenerator`. For example, [this is for `apply_transform`](https://keras.io/preprocessing/image/#apply_transform):

> `keras.preprocessing.image.apply_transform` 

which should simply be `apply_transform`, first because it is the method of a class (i.e. `ImageDataGenerator`) and second because the referenced module name is wrong (and this [has caused confusion](https://stackoverflow.com/q/51311062/2099607)).

All of this were caused by the fact that `clean_module_name()` was not called on the `function.__module__` in `render_function` (therefore this mostly affects the docs for `keras.preprocessing` and `keras.applications`). Plus, the way `autogen.py` works, the module name is repeated two times in the signature, but for the non-method functions it should be removed only once (that's why I have added a condition).
